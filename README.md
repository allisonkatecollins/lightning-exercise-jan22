Setup a simple application with just index.html and main.js (no browserify/grunt and no React).

1) This application should display the current date & time on the DOM
2) There should be a button that when clicked, updates the current date & time on the DOM
3) Push it up to Github 
4) Once you are finished, slack Emily or Leah your repo link

*notes: this is a simple web application, so you will need to run the http server
